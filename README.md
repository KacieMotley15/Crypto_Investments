# Cryptocurrency Investment Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing cryptocurrency market data using K-means clustering. The analysis includes data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and clustering of cryptocurrencies.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- hvplot.pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.

## Usage

1. Place the cryptocurrency market data CSV file (`crypto_market_data.csv`) in the `Resources` folder.
2. Run the `crypto_analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to analyze the cryptocurrency market data.

## Contents

The repository contains the following files:

- `crypto_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for analyzing cryptocurrency market data.
- `Resources/crypto_market_data.csv`: CSV file containing the cryptocurrency market data.

## Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Loading**: The market data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame from the `crypto_market_data.csv` file.
2. **Data Exploration**: Sample data is displayed, and summary statistics are generated to understand the data.
3. **Data Visualization**: The market data is visualized using line plots to gain insights into the trends.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is standardized using the `StandardScaler` module from scikit-learn to prepare it for clustering.
5. **Finding the Best Value for k**: The elbow method is used to find the optimal value of k (the number of clusters) for the K-means algorithm.
6. **Clustering with K-means**: The K-means algorithm is applied to cluster the cryptocurrencies based on their market data.

Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your requirements!

## Conclusion

This analysis provides a framework for analyzing and clustering cryptocurrency market data using K-means. It helps in understanding the patterns and similarities among different cryptocurrencies based on their market behavior.
