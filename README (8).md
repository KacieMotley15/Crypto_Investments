## Perspective of this Assignment
Role - Advisor at a top 5 firm

Goal -  novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies

Benefit - to decide what cryptocurrencies to invest in.




## How we will achieve our goal

The goal will be achieved by utilizing K-means clusters and elbow curves to see which investments will be best. 

The elbow curves will help us determine which dataset is the most promising.
